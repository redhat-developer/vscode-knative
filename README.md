# Knative & Serverless Functions for Visual Studio Code

[Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/) is an Open-Source Enterprise-level solution to build Serverless and Event Driven Applications. Thus running Serverless Containers in Kubernetes environments.

This extension for Knative provides the app developer the tools and experience needed when working with `Knative & Serverless Functions` on a Kubernetes cluster. Using this extension, developers can develop and deploy functions in a serverless way through guided IDE workflow.

## Requirements

*  Knative extension uses [kn cli](https://github.com/knative/client) `1.8.1` and [func cli](https://github.com/knative/func) `1.8.2`. The extension will offer to download and install the dependencies if needed.

* YAML is validated using the [VSCode-YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension

* Users can log in to Kubernetes cluster using [VSCode Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools).

  > NOTE: You will need to have the [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#the-kubeconfig-environment-variable) for the cluster that you are accessing stored locally.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes two views (Knative and Functions) and the following settings:

### Functions

* `function.explorer.create`: Create a new Knative Function in the current namespace
* `function.explorer.refresh`: Refresh the Functions tree view
* `function.explorer.repository`: Manage installed template repositories. Once added, a template from the repository can be used when creating a new function.

### Function Sessions

* This view is used to showcase Active command for a specified function. This includes Build, Deploy and Run sessions. Once the command is executed for a given function, the node is displayed in the Sessions View. Users can also `Stop` the executing action. The logs can be seen in the `Output Channel`.

### Knative

* `service.explorer.create`: Create a new Knative service in the current namespace
* `service.explorer.openFile`: Display yaml for selected item
* `service.explorer.refresh`: Refresh the Explorer tree view

## Commands and features

`vscode-knative` supports a number of commands for interacting with Knative and Knative Functions; these are accessible via the tree context menu and/or via the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` <kbd>⌘⇧P</kbd> on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` <kbd>⌃⇧P</kbd> on Windows and Linux)

### Functions

* `Knative: Create Function`: Open up a wizard to create a new Function project
* `Knative: Build Function`: Build the function project as a container image
* `Knative: Run`: Runs the function locally in the current directory or in the directory specified
* `Knative: Deploy Function`: Deploys a function to the currently configured Knative-enabled cluster.

* `Knative: Add Config to Function`: Allows configuration of Volume mounts, Environment variables for a function project
* `Knative: Remove Config from Function`: Remove Volume mounts, Environment variable from the function configuration
* `Knative: Open in Browser`: Open the deployed function in your browser
* `Knative: Refresh View`: Refresh the Function Tree View
