# Knative Serving & Eventing for Visual Studio Code

[Knative](https://knative.tips/intro/knative/) (pronounced kay-native) is a set of open source components for Kubernetes that implements functionality to:

  * run stateless workloads such as micro-services
  * event subscription, delivery and handling

on Kubernetes clusters.

This extension for Knative provides the app developer the tools and experience needed when working with Knative on a Kubernetes cluster. Using this extension, developers can view and deploy their applications in a serverless way.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

## Requirements

* YAML is validated using the [VSCode-YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
  
* Logging in to a Kubernetes cluster is done via the [Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) (ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools). 

  > NOTE: You will need to have the [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/#the-kubeconfig-environment-variable) for the cluster that you are accessing stored locally.

*  Knative is run on the [kn cli](https://github.com/knative/client). The extension will offer to download and install it if it can't find it.
